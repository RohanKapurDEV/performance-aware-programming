sim8086

Instruction decoder and simulator for the intel 8086 CPU made as part of Casey Muratori's Performance Aware Programming
course.

Funnily enough, despite the name of the course, this decoder is not performance aware at all since that wasn't the
objective of the project. That being said, it should work with the provided test asm files and any other ones as long as
they don't use any instructions that aren't implemented.
